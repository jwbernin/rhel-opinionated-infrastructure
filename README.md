# rhel-opinionated-infrastructure
An opinionated tool for building a RHEL-based infrastructure.

# Another tool? Why?
I'm developing this tool because I'm unhapy with the current selection of tools available for standing up a homelab
or an SOE for a RHEL-based environment. I'm basing much of the work on what Paul Armstrong has done in 
https://github.com/parmstro/rhis-builder-provisioner and related repositories. I'm not simply forking his work and 
modifying it because I believe it makes several core assumptions that are suboptimal. I'm taking his ideas and 
reimplementing them in ways that I have made work for customer environments, not just for my homelab.

# About me
I'm a senior architect in Red Hat's consulting delivery group. I was with Red Hat from 2004 to 2008, then rejoined in 2016.
I work primarily on infrastructure related engagements, including Satellite, IdM (Identity Management), AAP, HA (High Availability),
and of course base RHEL. This project is being developed on personal hardware and my personal GitHub account, is not sponsored 
by Red Hat, and should not be considered official. It is very much my opinion of how things should work. I am very much open to
suggestions for improvements, bug reports (once I have some code avialable), or code contributions, although I will insist
that any contributions be functional first on RHEL, and only then on other Linux OSes.
